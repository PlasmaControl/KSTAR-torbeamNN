# KSTAR-torbeamNN

Scripts used to train the TorbeamNN models for KSTAR. The raw data to generate the training dataset and the training dataset are not available due to KFE's data restriction policies. For access to the data, interested parties should reach out to [ekolemen@pppl.gov](mailto:ekolemen@pppl.gov).

Scripts for running the Torbeam code itself to generate the database are available on the DIII-D iris cluster to users.
